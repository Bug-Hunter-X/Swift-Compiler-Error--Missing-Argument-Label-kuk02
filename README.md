# Swift Compiler Error: Missing Argument Label

This example demonstrates a common Swift compiler error that arises when omitting parameter labels in function calls.  Swift's type system relies heavily on parameter labels to disambiguate function arguments. When labels are omitted, the compiler may not be able to resolve the correct parameters, leading to an error.

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect code that leads to the error. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides a solution by including the required parameter labels. This is essential for writing clear, maintainable, and error-free Swift code.
